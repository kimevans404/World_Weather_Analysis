# World_Weather_Analysis

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

At the most fundamental level, Jack needs help answering a question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels? Your first task was to define what you meant by "ideal." So, over the course of the conversation, you narrowed that to hotels that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client.

When you get back to your desk, your first step is to write out a basic plan for how you'll write code that can do this fairly complex task.

Here's an outline of your project plan:
- [ ] Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
- [ ] Purpose: PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
- [ ] Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
