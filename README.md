# World_Weather_Analysis

## Description
How might we provide real-time suggestions for a client's ideal hotels? The first task is to define what is "ideal." So, over the course of the challenge,  hotel options will be narrowed down to those that are (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client.

Here's an outline of the project plan:
- [x] Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
- [x] Purpose: Use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
- [x] Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

## Usage
This code will be most beneficial for planning trips when the client wants a specific weather experience. It could be used for vacations, filming, or group event planning especially since the code is filtered to search for hotels.
